# Northwind Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the **Northwind Data Warehouse Project** repository!

## Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is created with SQL script from Microsoft Sample Databases.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
